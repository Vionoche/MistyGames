# About
These projects are for learnings and experiments. Actually, I want to revive my experience in C++ because I haven't been using it for a long time. And, as always, to make it fun I've decided to involve this projects for simple games.

As Uncle Bob Martin always recommends to use different programming languages for repetition own programming skills. And I extremely agree.

The main goals:
   - Experimenting with using C# and C++ together. The first is for bisness logic and the second - for OpenGL coding.
   - Playing OpenGL and C++.
